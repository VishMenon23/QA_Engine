Created a small working model of a GPT-powered tutor to help generate relevant code for data analysis for students with no background in computer science.

The GPT-Powered Tutor aims to bridge the gap between non-computer science students and the complex world of data analysis. In today's data-driven society, the ability to analyze and interpret data has become essential across various fields. However, many students without a background in computer science often struggle with the technical aspects of coding and statistical analysis.

By leveraging the power of GPT, the tutor can understand natural language queries and provide relevant code snippets, step-by-step instructions, and suggestions tailored to the specific dataset and analysis requirements. This empowers students to explore and analyze their data effectively, even without prior programming experience.
